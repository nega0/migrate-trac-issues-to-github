# Migrate Trac tickets to GitHub Issues

This works with github.com and Github Enterprise

This script migrates issues from Trac to GitHub:

* Component & Ticket-Type are converted to labels
* Comments to tickets are copied over
* Basic conversion of Wiki Syntax in comments and descriptions
* All titles will be suffixed with `(Trac #<>)` for ease of searching
* All created issues will have the full Trac attributes appended to the issue body in JSON format
* Issue links (i.e. `#1`, `refs 1`, etc.) will be converted to use the corresponding Github issue number instead of the original Trac ticket ID
* Users not in GH will be added as labels

## Requirements

 * Python 2.7
 * Trac with the [XmlRpcPlugin](https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin)
 * [PyGithub](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyGithub)
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## How
```
./migrate.py --trac-url=https://trac.example.org --github-project=YOUR_USER/YOUR_PROJECT
```

## Example usage with Github Enterprise
```
./migrate.py --trac-url=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@trac.sample.local/mycustomer/project --github-api-url=https://github.sample.local/api/v3 --github-project=mycustomer/project
```

Note: Currently, you must leave USERNAME:PASSWORD _as_is, as it is replaced with the real user/pass in the script (will change, soon)

## Details

* You will be prompted for the username and password needed to access Trac, and GitHub password if needed. If your gitconfig has a section with github.token, or github.user and github.password, those values will automatically be used. It is recommended that you use a token (see https://github.com/settings/applications) instead of saving a real password:
```
  git config --local github.token TOKEN_VALUE
```

* You may use the --username-map option to specify a text file containing tab-separated lines with Trac username and equivalent GitHub username pairs. It is likely that you would not want to include usernames for people who are no longer working on your project as they may receive assignment notifications for old tickets. The GitHub API does not provide any way to suppress notifications.
